- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ethan-Loo. I'm a recent Bioinformatics Graduate from Northeastern University.
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Bioinformatics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create Python algorithms and functions to process bioinformatics data and how to perform statistical analyses on a range of data types.
I want to learn more about how to create and apply deep learning architectures to bioinformatics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Bioinformatics projects. I have a particular interest in omics data.
- 📫 You can reach me via [My LinkedIn Profle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-loo/) or by email at <loo.e@northeastern.edu>
